# Printerceptor ![license MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/andybezaire/Printerceptor)

You are now leveled up to verify your application output using *Swift Testing automated tests*. ðŸš€


## Overview

Verifying the output of your command line tool can be laborious, tedious, and sometimes tricky.  It might be hard to reproduce some edge cases, meaning that you either skip those tests, or perform testing less often. This can lead to wider problems.

`Printerceptor` was designed with these problems in mind.
Now you can forget about those laborious manual tests. Printerceptor allows you to capture your program output and verify so it is as you `#expect`.

ðŸ«µðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ‰

### NOTE: This function has GLOBAL effect, so your tests with output need to be run `.serialized`.

## Sample Use

```swift
import Testing

@Suite(.serialized)
struct ExampleTests {
    @Test func helloWorld() async throws {
        let capturedOutput = interceptStdout {
            print("Hello, World!")
        }

        #expect(capturedOutput == "Hello, World!")
    }
}
```
